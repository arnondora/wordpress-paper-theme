# Paper Theme for Wordpress
Paper Theme for blog wordpress. Based on Bootstrap. The 2.0 version is lighter, faster and easier to read.

#To Use in your site
Need to remove all of the unnecessary files to reduce the size of theme. These is the list of file that you have to remove before upload to the site
- /bower_components
- /node_modules
- /sass

#To Develop
I installed some tool for you to Develop this theme easier. I provided Gulp script to compile and minified CSS, JS and all of dependencies files together in single command. You can run <code>gulp watch</code> to run script right away when you save a SASS files
